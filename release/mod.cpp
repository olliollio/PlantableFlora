// Mod metadata for the DayZ launcher and the Steam Workshop upload.
// Lives in the root of the packed mod folder: @PlantableFlora\mod.cpp (next to Addons\ and keys\), not inside the addon source.
// pack.bat copies it there. The game resolves image paths in its file system (inside the PBOs, like CF does), not in
// this folder: the images live in the PBO under PlantableFlora\data\gui (loose copies next to this file are only a fallback).
// The Workshop preview image is set separately on the Steam page (Artwork\logo_large.png).
